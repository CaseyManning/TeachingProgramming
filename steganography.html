        <h1>Steganography</h1>
      </center>
      <p>
        Steganography is the practice of encoding information into places such
        as images that is undetectable to the causual observer, but can be extracted
        computationally to send information. In this project, we will be creating
        a program that can hide secret messages in pictures, and then can recieve
        messages that are encoded in the same way.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a computer, images are represented by three numbers, one for red, one for green, and one for blue.
        By combining different values of these three numbers, you can represent any color. The diagram below
        shows how as you move along the three axes labeled red, green, and blue, the color reperesented <body>
        the numbers changes.

      <p>
        For example, if we had the color <code>(red: 255, green: 0, blue: 255)</code>, we would have
        a bright purple color, since red and blue combine to make purple. On most systems,
        the numbers for colors range from 0 to 255, so 255 is the maximum.
      </p>

      <p>
        These numbers are the key to hiding information in an image. If you have at two colors,
        one with a red value of 75, and one with a value of 76, a computer knows that they
        are different, but if you were to look at them, you would have no idea they were
        different colors.
